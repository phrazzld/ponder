```markdown
# January 15, 2024: Monday

## 09:15:23

[User's journal content begins here]
```

### Filename Convention
- Format: `YYYYMMDD.md`
- Example: `20240115.md` for January 15, 2024
- Ensures natural sorting by date

### Configuration Schema
| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| PONDER_DIR | String | ~/journal | Journal directory path |
| PONDER_EDITOR | String | $EDITOR or vim | Editor command |

### Metadata Handling
- Date: Derived from filename
- Creation time: Stored in header on first open
- No complex metadata or frontmatter
- Human-readable format throughout

## 10. Security Considerations

### Threat Model
1. **Command Injection**
   - Attacker sets malicious PONDER_EDITOR value
   - Could execute arbitrary commands if not validated
   - PRIMARY SECURITY CONCERN

2. **Path Traversal**
   - Malicious PONDER_DIR could access unintended locations
   - Could potentially overwrite system files

3. **Information Disclosure**
   - Error messages could leak sensitive paths
   - Verbose logging might expose private data

### Security Controls

1. **Strict Editor Validation**
   - MUST be single command or path
   - NO spaces, arguments, or parameters allowed
   - NO shell metacharacters (`;|&$(){}[]<>'"\`)
   - Whitelist approach: only alphanumeric, dash, underscore, slash

2. **Path Sanitization**
   - Canonicalize all paths
   - Verify paths are absolute after expansion
   - Prevent directory traversal attempts

3. **Process Execution**
   - Use direct process spawn, never shell
   - Pass filenames as arguments, not in command string
   - No environment variable expansion in commands

4. **File Permissions**
   - Create files with 0600 (user read/write only)
   - Create directories with 0700 (user only)
   - Respect umask settings

### Data Protection
- All data stored locally
- No network connections
- No telemetry or analytics
- Future encryption via external tools only

### Access Control
- Relies on filesystem permissions
- Single-user design
- No sharing or collaboration features
