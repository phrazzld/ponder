## Critical Decisions (P0)

### ✅ ACCEPTED: Fix Temp File Permission Race (P0)
**Sources**: Codex inline comment (2025-10-25)
**Issue**: Temp files created with world-readable permissions, then tightened after plaintext written
**Decision**: CRITICAL SECURITY FIX - File exposed to other local users during decryption
**Effort**: 20min
**Rationale**: Clear security vulnerability with race condition window. Simple fix with high security value.

---

### ✅ ACCEPTED: Fix Passphrase Zeroization Leak (P0)
**Sources**: Reviews #2, #7 + Codex inline comment
**Issue**: `SqlCipherConfig` stores passphrase as plain `String`, defeating `SecretString` zeroization
**Decision**: CRITICAL SECURITY FIX - Passphrase lingers in heap after intended zeroization
**Effort**: 45min
**Rationale**: Defeats entire purpose of `SecretString`. Multiple reviewers independently flagged this.

---

### ✅ ACCEPTED: Fix Session Timeout Bug (P0)
**Sources**: Reviews #1, #2, #4, #5
**Issue**: `get_passphrase()` never updates `last_access`, causing premature session locks
**Decision**: CRITICAL BUG - Active users locked out during normal use
**Effort**: 30min (+ cascading changes to call sites)
**Rationale**: Genuine bug flagged by 4 independent reviewers. Breaks core UX promise of session management.

---

### ✅ ACCEPTED: Delete Stale Embeddings (P0)
**Sources**: Codex inline comment
**Issue**: When entry shortened, old chunks remain in DB, causing stale search results
**Decision**: CRITICAL DATA INTEGRITY - Orphaned embeddings corrupt search index
**Effort**: 15min
**Rationale**: Clear data integrity issue. Could surface old deleted content in searches.

## High-Priority Decisions (P1)

### ✅ ACCEPTED: Add Passphrase Strength Validation (P1)
**Sources**: Reviews #1, #2, #7
**Issue**: Accepts single-character passphrases with no warning
**Decision**: SECURITY BEST PRACTICE - 8-char minimum with user-friendly error
**Effort**: 45min
**Rationale**: Standard security practice. Prevents weak passphrases that undermine encryption.

- [Review #7](https://github.com/phrazzld/ponder/pull/50#issuecomment-3422841916) (Critical Issue #3)

---

### ✅ ACCEPTED: Guard Test Passphrase Env Var (P1)
**Sources**: Reviews #4, #6
**Issue**: `PONDER_TEST_PASSPHRASE` bypass in production code
**Decision**: SECURITY BEST PRACTICE - Wrap in `#[cfg(test)]`
**Effort**: 5min (trivial)
**Rationale**: Test code should never leak into production builds. Could be accidentally set.

---

### ✅ ACCEPTED: Add Passphrase Recovery Warning (P1)
**Sources**: Review #1
**Issue**: No documentation that forgotten passphrase = permanent data loss
**Decision**: CRITICAL DOCUMENTATION - Users must understand consequences
**Effort**: 15min
**Rationale**: Zero-knowledge encryption means no recovery. Users MUST know this upfront.

**Links**:
- [Review #1](https://github.com/phrazzld/ponder/pull/50#issuecomment-3417810907) (Documentation Gap - CRITICAL)

---

### ✅ ACCEPTED: Add Passphrase Retry Logic (P1)
**Sources**: Review #2
**Issue**: Wrong passphrase fails immediately instead of allowing retries
**Decision**: UX IMPROVEMENT - Standard security pattern (3 attempts like sudo)
**Effort**: 30min
**Rationale**: Standard UX pattern, reduces friction for typos.

**Links**:
- [Review #2](https://github.com/phrazzld/ponder/pull/50#issuecomment-3417819184) (Missing passphrase retry)

## Follow-Up Decisions (v2.1+)

### ✅ DEFERRED: Make Embedding Generation Atomic (v2.1)
**Sources**: Review #1
**Issue**: If Ollama crashes mid-embedding, DB left in inconsistent state
**Decision**: DEFER TO v2.1 - Not merge-blocking, but improves reliability
**Effort**: 2h
**Rationale**: Edge case (Ollama crash mid-operation). Standard DB transaction pattern can be added post-release.

**Links**:
- [Review #1](https://github.com/phrazzld/ponder/pull/50#issuecomment-3417810907) (High-Priority Issue #4)

---

### ✅ DEFERRED: Eliminate Redundant Decryption (v2.1)
**Sources**: Review #1
**Issue**: Code decrypts file immediately after encrypting for embeddings
**Decision**: DEFER TO v2.1 - Performance optimization, not correctness issue
**Effort**: 1h
**Rationale**: 50-100ms waste per edit. Nice optimization but not user-visible at this scale.

**Links**:
- [Review #1](https://github.com/phrazzld/ponder/pull/50#issuecomment-3417810907) (High-Priority Issue #6)

---

### ✅ DEFERRED: Document Secure Delete Limitations (v2.1)
**Sources**: Review #1
**Issue**: Zero-overwrite doesn't work on SSDs, not documented
**Decision**: DEFER TO v2.1 - Documentation improvement, users already using tmpfs
**Effort**: 15min
**Rationale**: Limitation is inherent to all secure-delete approaches. Document clearly but not merge-blocking.

**Links**:
- [Review #1](https://github.com/phrazzld/ponder/pull/50#issuecomment-3417810907) (High-Priority Issue #5)

---

### ✅ DEFERRED: Improve Wrong-Passphrase Detection (v2.1)
**Sources**: Review #1
**Issue**: String matching on error messages is brittle across SQLCipher versions
**Decision**: DEFER TO v2.1 - Robustness improvement, current approach works
**Effort**: 2h
**Rationale**: Current detection works for supported SQLCipher versions. More robust approach can wait.

**Links**:
- [Review #1](https://github.com/phrazzld/ponder/pull/50#issuecomment-3417810907) (High-Priority Issue #3)

---

### ✅ DEFERRED: Concurrent Access Tests (v2.1)
**Sources**: Reviews #2, #4, #7
**Issue**: No tests for multiple processes accessing DB simultaneously
**Decision**: DEFER TO v2.1 - Testing gap, but SQLite handles concurrency well
**Effort**: 3h
**Rationale**: SQLite's built-in locking handles most concurrency. Tests would add confidence but not blocking.

---

### ✅ DEFERRED: Ollama Timeout + Progress (v2.1)
**Sources**: Reviews #4, #6, #7
**Issue**: HTTP calls block indefinitely, no timeout, minimal progress
**Decision**: DEFER TO v2.1 - UX polish, current blocking behavior acceptable for v2.0
**Effort**: 2h
**Rationale**: Users expect embedding generation to take time. Better progress is nice-to-have.

---

### ✅ DEFERRED: Optimize Vector Search (v2.1/v2.2)
**Sources**: Review #7
**Issue**: O(n) vector search slow with 1000+ entries
**Decision**: DEFER TO v2.2 - Only affects power users with large journals
**Effort**: 1-2 days (sqlite-vss) or 3-4 days (hnswlib)
**Rationale**: Not an issue until journal hits 1000+ entries. Can optimize when needed.

**Links**:
- [Review #7](https://github.com/phrazzld/ponder/pull/50#issuecomment-3422841916) (Medium Priority #7)

---

### ✅ DEFERRED: Audit unwrap() Usage (v2.2)
**Sources**: Review #7
**Issue**: 133 unwraps across 11 files, some on user input
**Decision**: DEFER TO v2.2 - Code quality improvement, not causing issues now
**Effort**: 1 day
**Rationale**: Many unwraps are safe (constants, known-good values). Systematic audit can wait.

**Links**:
- [Review #7](https://github.com/phrazzld/ponder/pull/50#issuecomment-3422841916) (High Priority #5)

---

### ✅ DEFERRED: Schema Version Migration System (v2.1)
**Sources**: Reviews #6, #7
**Issue**: No migration path for future schema changes
**Decision**: DEFER TO v2.1 - Infrastructure for future, implement before first schema change
**Effort**: 4h
**Rationale**: v2.0 is first encrypted version. Implement migration system before v2.1 schema changes.

---

### ✅ DEFERRED: Create SECURITY.md (v2.1)
**Sources**: Review #4
**Issue**: Security considerations scattered, no comprehensive threat model
**Decision**: DEFER TO v2.1 - Documentation improvement, basics covered in CLAUDE.md
**Effort**: 2h
**Rationale**: CLAUDE.md documents threat model. Dedicated SECURITY.md would be better but not blocking.

**Links**:
- [Review #4](https://github.com/phrazzld/ponder/pull/50#issuecomment-3419126002) (Documentation Gaps #12)

---

## Rejected Items

### ❌ REJECTED: Fix unused parameter prefix (_reference_datetime)
**Sources**: Review #3
**Issue**: Parameter prefixed with `_` but actually used
**Decision**: FALSE POSITIVE - Underscore is Rust convention, parameter IS used
**Rationale**: Not a real issue. Underscore silences "unused" warning while keeping parameter for API consistency.

**Links**:
- [Review #3](https://github.com/phrazzld/ponder/pull/50#issuecomment-3419118385) (Code Quality)

---

### ❌ REJECTED: Add index on embeddings.entry_id
**Sources**: Review #6
**Issue**: Missing explicit index could slow queries
**Decision**: NOT NEEDED - Foreign key already indexed by SQLite query planner
**Rationale**: SQLite automatically creates indexes for foreign keys. Explicit index would be redundant.

**Links**:
- [Review #6](https://github.com/phrazzld/ponder/pull/50#issuecomment-3422841916) (Recommendations - Low Priority)

---

### ❌ REJECTED: First-run welcome message
**Sources**: Review #7
**Issue**: No welcome message on first run
**Decision**: LOW VALUE - Nice polish but not essential
**Rationale**: Adds complexity for minimal user benefit. Defer indefinitely unless user feedback requests it.

**Links**:
- [Review #7](https://github.com/phrazzld/ponder/pull/50#issuecomment-3422841916) (Low Priority #13)
