# T012 Implementation Plan: Add CI Config Parameter to Increase Timeouts for Flaky Tests

## Objective
Add or modify CI configuration to allow increased execution timeouts for flaky tests, specifically targeting file locking tests.

## Current State Analysis
Need to examine the existing CI workflow to understand current timeout settings and identify where to add increased timeouts for file locking tests.

## Implementation Approach
1. **Examine Current CI Configuration**
   - Locate and review existing CI workflow files
   - Understand current timeout settings
   - Identify the step that runs file locking tests

2. **Add Timeout Configuration**
   - Add timeout parameter to the test step that includes file locking tests
   - Set reasonable timeout value (likely 10-15 minutes for file locking tests)
   - Ensure it doesn't affect other tests unnecessarily

3. **Target File Locking Tests Specifically**
   - Use Cargo's test filtering to run locking tests with increased timeout
   - Keep regular timeout for other tests for efficiency

## Expected Changes
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (or similar CI workflow file)
- Add `timeout-minutes` parameter to relevant test steps
- Possibly separate file locking tests into their own step for better timeout control

## Success Criteria
- CI configuration includes increased timeout for file locking tests
- Other tests maintain normal timeout settings
- Configuration is clear and well-documented
- CI workflow passes with new timeout settings
