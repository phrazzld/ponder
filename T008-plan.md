# T008 Plan: Delete old errors.rs

## Objective
Remove the old errors.rs file to complete the module migration and resolve the module ambiguity error.

## Implementation Approach
1. Delete `src/errors.rs` file
2. Verify that `cargo check` passes after deletion
3. This should resolve the module ambiguity error between `errors.rs` and `errors/mod.rs`

## Steps
1. Remove `src/errors.rs`
2. Run `cargo check` to verify compilation

## Success Criteria
- errors.rs file is removed
- cargo check passes without module ambiguity errors
- Project compiles successfully (though may have other expected errors from incomplete migration)
