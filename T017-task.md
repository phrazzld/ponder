# Task ID: T017

## Title: Add File Locking for Concurrent Access

## Original Ticket Text
- [~] **T017: Add File Locking for Concurrent Access**
  - Implement advisory locks for journal files
  - Prevent data corruption from simultaneous writes
  - **Verification**: No data loss under concurrent access

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt
For task T017 - Add File Locking for Concurrent Access in Ponder:

Please analyze and provide a comprehensive implementation strategy for adding file locking to prevent data corruption from concurrent writes in the Ponder application. Consider:

1. **Scope and Impact Assessment**
   - Which files and functions need modification to implement file locking?
   - What's the minimal set of changes needed to safely implement this feature?
   - How will this change affect the user experience, if at all?

2. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Which Rust crate(s) would be appropriate for implementing file locking? Consider platform compatibility, ease of use, and maintenance burden.
   - At what points in the code should locks be acquired and released?
   - How should lock failure scenarios be handled and communicated to the user?
   - What new error types or variants may be needed?

3. **Design Decisions**
   - Should we use shared (read) locks vs exclusive (write) locks, or both?
   - How long should locks be held (e.g., only during file operations or throughout the entire editor session)?
   - What's the appropriate timeout strategy for lock acquisition?
   - How should we handle stale locks (if a process crashes while holding a lock)?

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - How can we effectively test file locking in both unit and integration tests?
   - What specific test cases should be implemented to verify proper locking behavior?
   - How can we simulate concurrent access in tests?

5. **Potential Risks and Mitigations**
   - What are potential pitfalls or edge cases with the chosen locking approach?
   - How will this implementation behave across different platforms (Unix, Windows, macOS)?
   - What mitigations can we implement for identified risks?

Please provide a clear, step-by-step implementation plan that addresses these considerations, with code examples where appropriate. Your analysis should prioritize simplicity, robustness, and alignment with the project's existing architecture and design principles.
