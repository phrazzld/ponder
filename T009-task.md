# T009: Add more robust error handling in tests (general)

## Task ID
T009

## Title
Add more robust error handling in tests (general)

## Original Ticket Text
- Review existing tests for areas where error handling can be improved
- Implement improvements to ensure tests fail with clear, informative messages
- **Verification**: Selected tests have improved error handling with clearer failure diagnostics

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt

You are tasked with improving error handling in the test suite for a Rust CLI journaling application called "ponder". The goal is to enhance test robustness by ensuring tests fail with clear, informative error messages rather than panics or unclear failures.

### Context
The application has a comprehensive test suite including:
- Unit tests within modules
- Integration tests in the tests/ directory
- Doc tests
- File locking tests with RAII cleanup
- Editor validation tests
- Security tests

### Current State Analysis Needed
1. **Test Failure Patterns**: Identify tests that currently use `panic!`, `unwrap()`, `expect()` with generic messages, or other patterns that could provide clearer failure diagnostics.

2. **Error Propagation**: Look for tests that could benefit from `Result` return types and the `?` operator for better error chaining.

3. **Assertion Quality**: Review assertion patterns to identify opportunities for more descriptive failure messages.

4. **Context Preservation**: Find cases where test failures lack sufficient context about the state that led to the failure.

### Implementation Guidelines
1. **Prioritize High-Impact Tests**: Focus on integration tests and complex unit tests that are most likely to fail in unclear ways.

2. **Maintain Test Philosophy Compliance**: 
   - Tests must remain "Self-Validating" with explicit assertions and clear pass/fail
   - Keep tests "Simple, clear, readable" as test code is production code
   - Preserve "Fast" execution - don't add unnecessary overhead

3. **Error Message Quality**: 
   - Include relevant context values in failure messages
   - Provide actionable information for debugging
   - Use descriptive assertions with custom messages where helpful

4. **Result-Based Error Handling**: 
   - Convert appropriate tests to return `Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>`
   - Use `?` operator for better error chaining
   - Provide clear error context when propagating failures

### Specific Areas to Investigate
1. File I/O operations in tests
2. Process spawning and management in locking tests
3. Temporary directory and file operations
4. Configuration loading and validation tests
5. CLI argument parsing tests
6. Error conversion and propagation tests

### Success Criteria
- Selected tests provide more informative failure messages
- Error context is preserved and helpful for debugging
- No degradation in test performance or reliability
- Maintainability of test code is improved
- Failure diagnostics help developers quickly identify root causes

### Constraints
- Do not modify test behavior or logic, only improve error reporting
- Maintain compatibility with existing test infrastructure
- Follow Rust best practices for error handling in tests
- Ensure changes align with the project's development philosophy
