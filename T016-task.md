## Title: Implement Structured Logging

## Original Ticket Text:
- [~] **T016: Implement Structured Logging**
  - Migrate from `env_logger` to `tracing` ecosystem
  - Configure structured JSON logging with all required context fields
  - Add correlation IDs for each application invocation
  - **Verification**: Logs include structured, searchable context fields

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt:

Analyze how to implement structured logging in the Ponder application, following these requirements:

1. **Current State Analysis**:
   - Examine the current logging implementation using `env_logger` and `log` crates
   - Identify all locations where logging is used and what information is currently logged
   - Determine if there are any tests that interact with logging

2. **Migration Strategy**:
   - Develop a plan to migrate from `env_logger` to the `tracing` ecosystem
   - Determine the necessary dependencies: likely `tracing`, `tracing-subscriber`, and `tracing-appender`
   - Design a solution for structured JSON output, considering options like `tracing-subscriber` with JSON formatting

3. **Correlation ID Implementation**:
   - Design a system to generate and track correlation IDs for each application invocation
   - Consider how to make correlation IDs available throughout the application
   - Decide where correlation IDs should be generated (e.g., at application startup)

4. **Required Context Fields**:
   - Identify what context fields should be included in all log entries (timestamp, log level, message, correlation ID, etc.)
   - Determine if different components need different context fields
   - Design a solution that allows optional context to be added when needed

5. **Testing Approach**:
   - Consider how to test the logging implementation
   - Determine if we need to capture and verify log output in tests

6. **Migration Plan**:
   - Outline the step-by-step process for implementing the changes
   - Consider backward compatibility and how to ensure logs remain useful during the transition
   - Identify any risks or potential issues with the migration

7. **Verification Strategy**:
   - Define how to verify that logs include all required structured fields
   - Determine how to verify correlation IDs are working properly
   - Consider how to test the JSON formatting and ensure it's valid and parseable

8. **Additional Considerations**:
   - Assess the impact on application performance and resource usage
   - Consider configuration options for controlling log levels and output destinations
   - Evaluate potential integration with log aggregation systems
