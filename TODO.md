# 🚨 URGENT: CI FAILURE RESOLUTION

**Issue**: CI failing on PR #48 - 2 out of 4 jobs failing  
**Target**: Get all tests passing and CI green  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - blocking deployment

## CI Failure Analysis ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Analysis**: Both build and file locking tests failing due to structured logging changes
- [x] **Documentation**: Created CI-FAILURE-SUMMARY.md and CI-RESOLUTION-PLAN.md  
- [x] **Root Cause**: Error message format changes and test assertion mismatches
