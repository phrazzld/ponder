### T202: User Experience Tests ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] T202.1: Add `test_user_friendly_error_output()` function ✅ **Integrated into existing tests**
- [x] T202.2: Test that stderr contains readable error messages ✅ **Complete**
- [x] T202.3: Test proper exit codes for different error types ✅ **Complete**
- [x] T202.4: Test that error messages don't contain raw Debug formatting ✅ **Complete**
- [x] T202.5: Verify enhanced error messages (from T004) still appear ✅ **Complete**

### T203: Error Format Tests ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] T203.1: Test JSON logging format in CI environment ✅ **Complete**
- [x] T203.2: Test text logging format in development ✅ **Complete**
- [x] T203.3: Test correlation_id presence in both formats ✅ **Complete**
- [x] T203.4: Test error chain visibility in structured logs ✅ **Complete**
- [x] T203.5: Test that no double logging occurs (verify T002 still works) ✅ **Complete**
