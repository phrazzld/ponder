# T018 Plan: Update README.md

## Goal
Update the README.md with comprehensive information about the Ponder project, including detailed project description, features, installation instructions, usage examples, configuration details, and architecture overview.

## Current State
The current README.md has basic information about the project but lacks details about:
- Specific CLI command options (retro, reminisce)
- Configuration options
- Installation instructions
- Architecture overview
- Detailed examples

## Implementation Plan

1. Enhance project description with more details about what Ponder does
2. Expand features section to include all supported functionality
3. Add installation instructions
4. Add detailed usage examples covering all CLI commands
5. Add configuration section explaining environment variables
6. Add architecture overview section
7. Update contributing section with more specific guidelines
8. Ensure markdown formatting is consistent and appealing

## Verification
- Check that README renders correctly in a markdown previewer
- Ensure all important features and options are documented
