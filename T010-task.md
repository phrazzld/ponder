## Title
Use deterministic values in tests where possible

## Original Ticket Text
- Identify and refactor tests that use non-deterministic values
- Replace with deterministic inputs or mock equivalents
- **Verification**: Flakiness due to non-deterministic test data is reduced

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt

### Context
You are implementing a task to improve test determinism in a Rust journaling CLI application. The goal is to identify and refactor tests that use non-deterministic values, replacing them with deterministic inputs or mock equivalents to reduce test flakiness.

### Task Requirements
1. Identify all tests that use non-deterministic values such as:
   - Current date/time from system clock
   - Random values
   - System-dependent paths or environment variables
   - File system timestamps
   - Process IDs or other runtime-dependent values

2. Refactor these tests to use deterministic values:
   - Fixed dates/times instead of current time
   - Predictable values instead of random ones
   - Controlled test environments instead of system dependencies
   - Mock or stub time-dependent functionality where appropriate

3. Ensure tests maintain their validity and coverage after refactoring

4. Follow the Development Philosophy principles:
   - Simplicity and clarity
   - Testability-first design
   - No unnecessary abstractions
   - Direct function calls over complex patterns

### Analysis Questions
1. What are the main sources of non-determinism in the current test suite?
2. Which test files are most affected by non-deterministic values?
3. What strategies can be employed to make date/time-based tests deterministic?
4. How can we ensure tests remain valid and meaningful after making them deterministic?
5. Are there any tests where non-determinism is actually necessary or beneficial?

### Expected Deliverables
1. A comprehensive list of tests using non-deterministic values
2. A strategy for making each category of non-determinism deterministic
3. Refactored tests with deterministic values
4. Verification that tests still provide proper coverage and validation

### Success Criteria
- All identified non-deterministic tests are refactored to use deterministic values
- Tests continue to pass and provide meaningful validation
- Test flakiness is measurably reduced
- Code follows Rust best practices and project conventions
- Changes are well-documented with clear commit messages
