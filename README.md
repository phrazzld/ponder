## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

Ponder can be configured using environment variables:

| Environment Variable | Description | Default |
|----------------------|-------------|---------|
| `PONDER_DIR` | The directory where journal entries are stored | `~/Documents/rubberducks` |
| `PONDER_EDITOR` | The editor to use for journal entries | Uses `EDITOR` if set |
| `EDITOR` | Fallback editor if `PONDER_EDITOR` is not set | `vim` |

### Example Configuration

```bash
# Add to your .bashrc, .zshrc, etc.
export PONDER_DIR="~/journals"
export PONDER_EDITOR="code -w"
```

## File Structure üìÅ

Journal entries are stored as markdown files in the configured journal directory, with filenames in the format `YYYYMMDD.md` (e.g., `20240508.md`).

When you open a journal entry, the current timestamp is automatically added to the file if it doesn't already exist, providing a convenient way to track when you wrote each entry.

## Architecture üèóÔ∏è

Ponder follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- `cli`: Command-line interface handling using clap
- `config`: Configuration loading and validation
- `editor`: Editor abstraction for opening journal files
- `errors`: Error handling infrastructure
- `journal`: Core journal functionality with dependency injection

The codebase is designed with testability in mind, using dependency injection and trait-based abstractions to allow for easy mocking and testing.
