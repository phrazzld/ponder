- **Customizable**: Configure your preferred editor and journal directory
- **Simple Interface**: Minimal CLI interface with intuitive commands
- **Markdown Support**: Journal entries are stored as plain markdown files

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-r, --retro` | Opens entries from the past week (excluding today) |
| `-m, --reminisce` | Opens entries from significant past time intervals |
| `-d, --date DATE` | Opens an entry for a specific date (YYYY-MM-DD or YYYYMMDD format) |
| `-v, --verbose` | Enables verbose output for debugging |

```bash

```

Open an entry for a specific date:
```bash
ponder --date 2023-05-15
# or
ponder --date 20230515
```

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

Ponder can be configured using environment variables:

| Environment Variable | Description | Default |
|----------------------|-------------|---------|
| `PONDER_DIR` | The directory where journal entries are stored | `~/Documents/rubberducks` |
| `PONDER_EDITOR` | The editor to use for journal entries | Uses `EDITOR` if set |
| `EDITOR` | Fallback editor if `PONDER_EDITOR` is not set | `vim` |

### Example Configuration

```bash
# Add to your .bashrc, .zshrc, etc.
export PONDER_DIR="~/journals"
export PONDER_EDITOR="code -w"
```

## File Structure üìÅ

Journal entries are stored as markdown files in the configured journal directory, with filenames in the format `YYYYMMDD.md` (e.g., `20240508.md`).

When you open a journal entry, the current timestamp is automatically added to the file if it doesn't already exist, providing a convenient way to track when you wrote each entry.

## Architecture üèóÔ∏è

Ponder follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- `cli`: Command-line interface handling using clap
- `config`: Configuration loading and validation
- `editor`: Editor abstraction for opening journal files
- `errors`: Error handling infrastructure
- `journal`: Core journal functionality with dependency injection

The codebase is designed with testability in mind, using dependency injection and trait-based abstractions to allow for easy mocking and testing.

### Development Setup

To set up your development environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/phrazzld/ponder.git
cd ponder

# Install pre-commit hooks (recommended)
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

### Code Formatting and Linting

We use automated tools to ensure consistent code style:

- **rustfmt**: Automatically formats Rust code
  ```bash
  cargo fmt
  ```

- **clippy**: Provides linting and code improvement suggestions
  ```bash
  cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
  ```

- **pre-commit hooks**: Automatically run formatters and linters before each commit
  - The hooks will run automatically when you commit changes
  - To run them manually: `pre-commit run --all-files`

The repository includes:
- `.rustfmt.toml` - Configuration for rustfmt
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Configuration for pre-commit hooks
- `.vscode/settings.json` - Settings for VS Code users
- `.editorconfig` - Settings for various editors
