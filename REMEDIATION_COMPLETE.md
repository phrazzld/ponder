# Remediation Complete - Sprint 1

## Overview
All tasks from the remediation plan for Sprint 1 have been successfully completed. This included addressing two critical issues:

1. **CR-01: Dead Code Suppressions** - `#[allow(dead_code)]` attributes have been replaced with proper code scoping
2. **CR-02: Structured Logging** - `println!` statements have been replaced with structured logging

## Completed Tasks

### Dead Code Remediation (CR-01)
- ✅ T016-T019: Reviewed `#[allow(dead_code)]` instances across all modules
- ✅ T020: Implemented fixes for all identified `#[allow(dead_code)]` issues
- ✅ T024: Updated TODO.md to accurately track task status
- ✅ T025: Scoped `CliArgs::parse_date()` to tests using `#[cfg(test)]`
- ✅ T026: Scoped `Config::new()` to tests using `#[cfg(test)]`
- ✅ T027: Addressed `dead_code` for `JournalIO::ensure_journal_dir()` by making it actively used
- ✅ T028: Scoped `JournalService` test-only methods to tests using `#[cfg(test)]`
- ✅ T029: Performed final sweep for any remaining `dead_code` issues
- ✅ T031: Updated TODO.md to mark tasks as complete

### Logging Remediation (CR-02)
- ✅ T021: Replaced `println!` at `src/journal/mod.rs:536` with `log::info!`
- ✅ T022: Replaced `println!` at `src/journal/mod.rs:544` with `log::info!`
- ✅ T023: Initialized structured JSON logging in application entry point
- ✅ T030: Manually verified operational messages are output via structured logging

## Test Validation
- All modules have been thoroughly tested
- Clippy passes with no warnings or errors: `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- Tests pass successfully: `cargo test`
- Manual verification confirms operational messages are correctly output in JSON format

## Key Architectural Improvements
1. **Better Test Isolation**: Test-only code is now properly scoped with `#[cfg(test)]`
2. **Active Use of Public Trait Methods**: Ensured public trait methods are actively used
3. **Structured Logging**: Implemented JSON-formatted logs with timestamp, level, and message
4. **Improved JournalService Design**: Made the `config` field test-only

## Next Steps
With Sprint 1 complete, the codebase is now free of `#[allow(dead_code)]` suppressions and uses structured logging throughout. This provides a solid foundation for future enhancements and features.
