# T015 Plan: Refactor main.rs flow

## Analysis

Task **T015** involves refactoring the main.rs flow to ensure it follows the proper orchestration pattern, using the new module structure that was created in previous tasks. Looking at the current state of main.rs, I can see that it's already close to the desired structure, but there are still some adjustments needed to fully match the specified flow.

## Current State

The main.rs file is already using:
- `CliArgs::parse()` for parsing CLI arguments
- `Config::load()` and `config.validate()` for loading and validating configuration 
- `journal_io::ensure_journal_directory_exists()` to create the journal directory
- `args.to_date_specifier()` to convert CLI args to a DateSpecifier
- `date_spec.resolve_dates()` to get the dates to open
- `journal_io::open_journal_entries()` to open the entries

The current flow is mostly aligned with the desired structure, but some error handling and specific function names need to be adjusted to match the exact requirements in the ticket.

## Implementation Plan

1. Review the current main.rs code flow and compare it to the ticket requirements
2. Modify the code to follow the exact pattern specified in T015:
   - Simplify error handling where appropriate
   - Make sure the function calls and variable names match the requirements
   - Ensure that the journal_core and journal_io modules are used correctly
3. Run tests to ensure everything still works properly

## Specific Changes Needed

From comparing the current code to the requirements:

1. The main structure is already correct, but some of the error handling can be simplified
2. The variable naming should be adjusted to match exactly what's in the ticket
3. The DateSpecifier creation logic is already delegated to CliArgs::to_date_specifier() method

## Implementation Approach

1. Keep the logging setup as is
2. Adjust the error handling to be more concise where possible
3. Update variable names to match the ones in the ticket description

## Complexity Assessment

This task is **Simple** because:
- It only involves a single file (main.rs)
- The changes are mostly cosmetic, renaming variables and reorganizing code
- The core functionality already exists
- The logic is straightforward and well-defined
