# T016 - Plan for Writing Integration Tests

## Task Description
Create comprehensive integration tests for the Ponder application that verify the interactions between modules and test the CLI behavior.

## Approach
1. Create a `tests` directory at the project root (this is Rust's standard location for integration tests)
2. Add integration tests that focus on:
   - End-to-end application flows
   - Component interactions
   - CLI argument parsing and execution
   - Error handling
3. Use appropriate testing crates:
   - `assert_cmd` for testing CLI applications
   - `predicates` for assertions
   - `tempfile` for temporary test directories
   - `serial_test` for tests that can't run in parallel

## Implementation Steps
1. Add necessary test dependencies to `Cargo.toml`
2. Create a `tests` directory with separate test files:
   - `cli_tests.rs` - Test CLI argument handling
   - `journal_integration_tests.rs` - Test JournalService with real dependencies
   - `config_tests.rs` - Test configuration loading and validation
3. Set up test helpers and fixtures for common operations
4. Implement tests for key application flows:
   - Creating and opening today's journal entry
   - Opening retro entries
   - Opening reminisce entries
   - Opening entries for specific dates
   - Handling of configuration errors
   - CLI argument validation
5. Run tests and verify they pass

## Success Criteria
- Integration tests cover all key application flows
- CLI behavior is thoroughly tested
- Error handling paths are verified
- All tests pass
