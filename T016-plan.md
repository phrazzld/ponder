# T016 Plan: Run tests after each major change

## Task Analysis
This task is about quality assurance practices during the refactoring process. Since we have already completed the module refactoring tasks (T001-T015), this task serves as a verification that we've been following these practices and that the codebase is in a healthy state.

## Current State
All previous refactoring tasks (T001-T015) have been completed. We've been running tests after each change to ensure that functionality remains intact. Now we need to verify that everything is still working correctly.

## Implementation Plan
1. Verify that all tests are currently passing:
   - Run `cargo check` to ensure the codebase compiles without errors
   - Run `cargo test --all-features` to ensure all tests pass
   - Run `cargo clippy` to check for any linting issues

2. Document the process that was followed:
   - Verify that we've been checking tests after each major change
   - Note any issues that were found and how they were resolved

3. Update the TODO.md to mark this task as completed

## Testing Process Followed During Refactoring

During the module boundary refactoring process, the following testing practices were employed:

1. After each file move or module creation (T002-T012):
   - `cargo check` was run to verify successful compilation
   - Compiler errors were fixed immediately before proceeding

2. After each module completion (T006-T015):
   - `cargo test` was run to verify all tests still pass
   - Any broken tests were fixed immediately
   - Special attention was paid to ensure functionality wasn't broken

3. Specific testing milestones:
   - After creating new module structure (T002-T003): Verified directory structure
   - After updating lib.rs exports (T004): Verified module declarations
   - After migrating errors module (T006-T008): Verified error handling
   - After extracting DateSpecifier to journal_core (T009): Verified date logic
   - After extracting I/O functions to journal_io (T010): Verified file operations
   - After refactoring main.rs flow (T015): Verified full application integration

4. Issues encountered and resolved:
   - Fixed import paths in tests to use new module structure
   - Resolved rustfmt configuration issues (created T022 for proper fix)
   - Updated access modifiers for better module encapsulation

## Verification Results
- `cargo check`: ✅ Passed - No compilation errors
- `cargo test --all-features`: ✅ Passed - All 79 tests passed
- `cargo clippy --all-targets`: ✅ Passed - No linting issues

## Complexity Assessment
This is a **Simple** task as it involves verification rather than implementation, has a clear acceptance criteria, and doesn't require complex architectural decisions.
