# T011: Add better debug output for test failures

## Task ID
T011

## Title
Add better debug output for test failures

## Original Ticket Text
- Enhance selected tests to provide more detailed debug output when failures occur
- Include relevant state and input values in failure logs
- **Verification**: Diagnosing failures is easier due to improved contextual information

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt

### Context
You are implementing a task to improve debug output for test failures in a Rust journaling CLI application. The goal is to enhance selected tests to provide more detailed debug output when failures occur, including relevant state and input values in failure logs, making it easier to diagnose test failures.

### Task Requirements
1. Identify tests that would benefit from enhanced debug output:
   - Tests with complex assertions
   - Tests involving file operations or external processes
   - Tests with multiple steps or state changes
   - Integration tests that span multiple components

2. Enhance debug output by:
   - Adding contextual information to assertion messages
   - Including relevant state and input values in failure logs
   - Providing clear, actionable diagnostic information
   - Ensuring debug output is helpful but not overwhelming

3. Consider different types of debug information:
   - File system state (paths, contents, permissions)
   - Process information (exit codes, stdout/stderr)
   - Configuration values and environment variables
   - Timing information for performance-sensitive tests
   - Data structures and intermediate computation results

4. Follow the Development Philosophy principles:
   - Clarity and explicitness in error messages
   - Simplicity in implementation
   - Avoid unnecessary abstractions
   - Focus on practical debugging value

### Analysis Questions
1. Which test files contain tests that would most benefit from enhanced debug output?
2. What types of test failures are most difficult to diagnose currently?
3. What specific debug information would be most valuable for each type of test?
4. How can we present debug information in a clear, organized way?
5. What are the performance implications of adding debug output?
6. How can we ensure debug output doesn't interfere with normal test execution?

### Expected Deliverables
1. Analysis of current test suite to identify enhancement opportunities
2. Strategy for different types of debug output enhancements
3. Enhanced test assertions with better contextual information
4. Improved error messages with relevant state information
5. Documentation of debug output patterns for future tests

### Success Criteria
- Selected tests provide significantly more useful debug information on failures
- Debug output includes relevant state and input values
- Failure messages are clear and actionable
- No degradation in test performance or reliability
- Changes follow Rust best practices and project conventions
- Debug enhancements are well-documented and consistent
