## High Priority

### Core Architecture & Philosophy Alignment

-   **[Refactor]**: Eliminate Unnecessary Trait Abstractions (`JournalIO`, `Editor`)
    -   **Complexity**: Medium
    -   **Rationale**: Current traits add unnecessary complexity and indirection for a single-implementation CLI, violating "Simplicity First". Direct use of concrete types simplifies code, improves readability, and is a prerequisite for effective integration testing.
    -   **Expected Outcome**: `JournalIO` and `Editor` traits and their associated mock implementations are removed. Code directly uses `std::fs`, `std::process::Command`, or similar standard library features. The `JournalService` (if retained) will use concrete types.
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Remove the `JournalIO` and `Editor` traits
        - Replace trait objects with concrete implementations
        - Use `std::fs` operations directly where appropriate
        - Refactor `main.rs` to use concrete types
    -   **Dependencies**: Enables "Replace Mock-Based Tests with Integration Tests".

-   **[Refactor]**: Simplify or Eliminate `JournalService`
    -   **Complexity**: Medium
    -   **Rationale**: The `JournalService` struct primarily serves to hold trait objects for dependency injection. With trait elimination, its purpose needs re-evaluation to align with "Simplicity First" and reduce conceptual overhead.
    -   **Expected Outcome**: Core logic previously in `JournalService` is refactored into a simpler structure (e.g., free functions within relevant modules, or a significantly simplified struct if state is truly necessary). The application flow in `main.rs` is streamlined.
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Move core logic to a simpler structure or free functions
        - Remove dependency on trait objects
        - Simplify main.rs flow
    -   **Dependencies**: Eliminate Unnecessary Trait Abstractions.

-   **[Refactor]**: Enhance Modularity and Separation of Concerns
    -   **Complexity**: Medium
    -   **Rationale**: Aligns with "Modularity is Mandatory" and "Separation of Concerns". The current structure mixes different concerns (CLI, file I/O, date logic) in `main.rs`. Extracting logic into dedicated modules improves organization, testability, and maintainability.
    -   **Expected Outcome**: Application logic is organized into logical modules (e.g., `src/cli.rs`, `src/journal_io.rs`, `src/date_utils.rs`, `src/config.rs`, `src/editor.rs`, `src/errors.rs`). `main.rs` becomes a thin orchestrator.
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Identify logical separation points in the codebase
        - Extract functionality into well-defined modules
        - Ensure each module has a clear, single responsibility
        - Update imports and make `main.rs` an orchestrator
    -   **Dependencies**: None (but facilitates testing and error handling improvements).

-   **[Fix]**: Audit and Remediate Linter/Compiler Suppressions (`#[allow(...)]`)
    -   **Complexity**: Simple
    -   **Rationale**: Aligns with the core philosophy of fixing root causes rather than suppressing issues ("Address Violations, Don't Suppress"). Suppressions hide technical debt or bugs, undermining maintainability and reliability.
    -   **Expected Outcome**: A codebase free of unjustified `#[allow(...)]` attributes. Any remaining suppressions are documented with clear rationale (e.g., `// ALLOWANCE: Reason...`) and consciously accepted.
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Search codebase for all `#[allow(...)]` attributes
        - Evaluate each case to determine if the root cause can be fixed
        - Fix root causes where possible
        - Document any remaining suppressions with clear justification
        - Add tests to confirm fixed issues remain resolved

### Testing Strategy & Quality

-   **[Refactor]**: Replace Mock-Based Internal Tests with Behavior-Driven Integration Tests
    -   **Complexity**: Medium
    -   **Rationale**: Addresses "Current Architecture Issues" (complex mock-based testing) and a critical violation of the "Testing Strategy" philosophy ("NO Mocking Internal Collaborators"). Current tests are brittle and coupled to implementation details. Integration tests verify actual application behavior.
    -   **Expected Outcome**: All tests relying on internal mocks (`MockJournalIO`, `MockEditor`) are replaced with integration tests (in `tests/` directory) that interact with a real (temporary) filesystem and use simple system commands (like `echo` or `true`) to simulate editor behavior. Tests verify observable outcomes (file content, exit codes).
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Create integration tests using `assert_cmd` and `tempfile`
        - Test file system operations with temporary directories
        - Use simple editor commands (like `true` or `echo`) for testing
        - Remove all internal mocks
        - Reduce reliance on `#[cfg(test)]` public methods/fields
    -   **Dependencies**: Eliminate Unnecessary Trait Abstractions.

-   **[Enhancement]**: Implement Comprehensive Automated Testing Strategy & Coverage Enforcement
    -   **Complexity**: Complex
    -   **Rationale**: Aligns with "Design for Testability" and "Test Coverage Enforcement". A robust testing strategy is fundamental for verifying correctness, preventing regressions, and enabling safe code evolution.
    -   **Expected Outcome**:
        -   Unit tests (`#[test]` in `src/.../tests.rs` submodules) cover core pure logic (date calculations, filename generation, parsing).
        -   Integration tests (in the `tests/` directory) simulate CLI execution (`assert_cmd`), interact with a temporary filesystem (`tempfile`), and verify command behavior end-to-end.
        -   Doc tests (`///`) for public API elements.
        -   Test coverage reporting (e.g., `cargo-tarpaulin`) is integrated into CI, with an initial target threshold (e.g., 80%) defined and enforced. Builds fail if coverage drops.
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Write unit tests for core logic components
        - Create integration tests for key workflows 
        - Add doc tests for public APIs
        - Configure test coverage reporting
        - Set up enforcement of coverage thresholds in CI
    -   **Dependencies**: Enhance Modularity and Separation of Concerns, Implement CI Pipeline for Automated Checks.

### Error Handling & Logging

-   **[Refactor]**: Standardize Error Handling, Eliminate Panics, and Prevent Double Logging
    -   **Complexity**: Medium
    -   **Rationale**: Addresses "Inconsistent error handling and logging" and aligns with "Consistent Error Handling" and "Robustness". Current `unwrap()`/`expect()` usage, and error logging patterns lead to fragile application behavior and cluttered logs.
    -   **Expected Outcome**: All `unwrap()`/`expect()` calls on `Result`/`Option` in recoverable paths are replaced with `?` or proper error handling. Custom error types using `thiserror` provide clear context. Errors are propagated cleanly and logged only once at the application boundary (e.g., in `main.rs`). `AppError::Io`'s `Clone` implementation is fixed if cloning is truly necessary, or `Clone` is removed. `main` returns `Result`.
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Remove `Clone` implementation for `AppError`
        - Use `thiserror` features for proper context
        - Eliminate `.map_err(|e| { error!(...); e })` pattern
        - Log errors only at the top level
        - Replace all `unwrap()`/`expect()` with proper error handling
    -   **Dependencies**: None. Enables "Implement Structured, Contextual Logging".

-   **[Enhancement]**: Implement Structured, Contextual Logging with `tracing`
    -   **Complexity**: Medium
    -   **Rationale**: Addresses "Inconsistent error handling and logging" and aligns with "Logging Strategy" ("Structured Logging is Mandatory", "Context Propagation"). Current logging is basic. `tracing` provides richer, structured logs essential for debugging and observability.
    -   **Expected Outcome**: `tracing` and `tracing-subscriber` are integrated. Logs are output in JSON format (especially in CI/non-interactive environments). All log entries include mandatory context fields: `timestamp`, `level`, `message`, `target` (module path), `correlation_id` (unique ID generated per application invocation), and `error_details` (for ERROR level logs).
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Add dependencies for `tracing` ecosystem
        - Generate correlation ID per invocation
        - Configure JSON output with mandatory context fields
        - Log only at appropriate boundaries
        - Add static `service_name` to logs
    -   **Dependencies**: Standardize Error Handling, Eliminate Panics, and Prevent Double Logging.

### Developer Workflow & Automation

-   **[Enhancement]**: Implement CI Pipeline for Automated Checks (e.g., GitHub Actions)
    -   **Complexity**: Medium
    -   **Rationale**: Aligns with "Automate Everything", "Quality Gates", and "CI/CD" philosophy. Essential for consistent code quality, early regression detection, and automating repetitive checks, which improves developer experience.
    -   **Expected Outcome**: A CI workflow is configured to run on every push and pull request. The workflow executes:
        1.  Code formatting check (`cargo fmt --check`).
        2.  Strict linting (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`).
        3.  Automated tests (`cargo test --all-features`).
        4.  Test coverage check (once "Implement Comprehensive Automated Testing Strategy" is done).
        5.  Dependency vulnerability scanning (`cargo audit`).
        Builds fail on any violation. A build status badge is added to `README.md`.
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Create `.github/workflows` directory
        - Create CI workflow file for running on push and pull requests
        - Configure tests to run in CI
        - Configure linters and type checking
        - Set up test coverage reporting
        - Add build status badge to README.md
    -   **Dependencies**: Enforce Consistent Code Formatting, Enforce Strict Code Linting.

-   **[Enhancement]**: Setup Local Pre-commit Hooks
    -   **Complexity**: Simple
    -   **Rationale**: Aligns with "Local Development: Pre-commit Hooks" philosophy. Catches formatting, linting, and basic compilation issues locally before commit, reducing CI failures and providing faster feedback.
    -   **Expected Outcome**: A pre-commit framework (e.g., `pre-commit` with Rust support, or `husky`) is configured to run `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, and `cargo check` (at minimum) before each commit. Commits are blocked if hooks fail.
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Install pre-commit framework
        - Configure linting and formatting checks
        - Add type checking
        - Prevent commit of sensitive data and large files
        - Enforce conventional commit format
        - Configure pre-push hooks to run complete test suite
    -   **Dependencies**: Enforce Consistent Code Formatting, Enforce Strict Code Linting.

-   **[Enhancement]**: Enforce Consistent Code Formatting (`rustfmt`)
    -   **Complexity**: Simple
    -   **Rationale**: Aligns with "Code Quality" and Rust Appendix (Tooling, Formatting). Ensures a consistent code style, improving readability and reducing cognitive load.
    -   **Expected Outcome**: `rustfmt` is configured (default or with `rustfmt.toml`). All code adheres to the standard format, enforced by pre-commit hooks and CI checks.
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Configure rustfmt with default or custom settings
        - Add formatting check to CI 
        - Add formatting check to pre-commit hooks
        - Format all existing code
    -   **Dependencies**: Part of Implement CI Pipeline and Setup Local Pre-commit Hooks.

-   **[Enhancement]**: Enforce Strict Code Linting (`clippy`)
    -   **Complexity**: Simple
    -   **Rationale**: Aligns with "Code Quality" and Rust Appendix (Linting). `clippy` catches common pitfalls, potential bugs, and style issues, improving code quality and robustness.
    -   **Expected Outcome**: `clippy` is configured for strictness (e.g., `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` or via `Cargo.toml`/`clippy.toml`). All `clippy` checks pass in pre-commit hooks and CI.
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Configure clippy for strict checks
        - Add linting to CI
        - Add linting to pre-commit hooks
        - Fix existing linting issues
    -   **Dependencies**: Part of Implement CI Pipeline and Setup Local Pre-commit Hooks.

### User-Facing Features

-   **[Feature]**: Encryption for Journal Files (at rest)
    -   **Complexity**: Complex
    -   **Rationale**: Enhances user privacy and data security by protecting sensitive journal entries from unauthorized access (User Value Prioritization #3).
    -   **Expected Outcome**: Option to encrypt journal files (e.g., using a library like `age` or `ring`). Requires a password or key to decrypt and access entries. Clear CLI commands/options for managing encrypted journals.
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Research encryption approaches for files at rest
        - Add encryption/decryption to file operations
        - Add password/key management
        - Update CLI to support encrypted journals
        - Document encrypted journal usage
    -   **Dependencies**: Implement Externalized Configuration Management, Bolster Security Practices.

-   **[Feature]**: Support for Cross-Device Sync
    -   **Complexity**: Complex
    -   **Rationale**: Enables users to maintain their journal across multiple devices, enhancing the utility and accessibility of the tool.
    -   **Expected Outcome**: Journal entries can be synchronized between multiple devices, ensuring consistency and availability of entries regardless of which device is used.
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Design sync mechanism (e.g., Git-based, cloud storage)
        - Implement sync commands in CLI
        - Add conflict resolution strategy
        - Document sync setup and usage
        - Consider combining with encryption for secure sync
    -   **Dependencies**: Implement Externalized Configuration Management. Consider with "Encryption for Journal Files" for secure sync.

## Medium Priority

### Configuration & Usability

-   **[Feature]**: Implement Externalized Configuration Management
    -   **Complexity**: Medium
    -   **Rationale**: Aligns with "Configuration Management" philosophy. Hardcoded paths and sole reliance on `$EDITOR` limit user flexibility. Externalized configuration improves usability, adaptability, and is a prerequisite for features like multiple journals or encryption.
    -   **Expected Outcome**: Journal directory path, default editor fallback, and potentially other settings (e.g., date formats, reminisce intervals) are configurable via environment variables (e.g., `PONDER_DIR`, `PONDER_EDITOR`) and/or a configuration file (e.g., XDG compliant `~/.config/ponder/config.toml`). Sensible defaults are used if no configuration is found. Configuration loading logic is centralized and documented.
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Define configuration file format
        - Implement config file loading
        - Add environment variable support
        - Set sensible defaults
        - Document configuration options
    -   **Dependencies**: Enhance Modularity and Separation of Concerns. Enables "Encryption for Journal Files", "Journaling Templates", "Support for Multiple Journals".

-   **[Enhancement]**: Improve CLI Argument Parsing and Help Messages
    -   **Complexity**: Simple
    -   **Rationale**: Aligns with "API Design" (for CLIs) and improves "Enhanced usability" (#4 user value). Clear CLI is essential for user experience and feature discoverability.
    -   **Expected Outcome**: `clap` struct definitions are reviewed and enhanced for clarity and consistency. All options and subcommands have comprehensive, user-friendly help messages, including examples where appropriate. Argument naming follows standard conventions. Redundant wrappers like `CliArgs::parse()` are removed.
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Review and enhance clap configuration
        - Add detailed help messages and examples
        - Standardize argument naming
        - Remove redundant wrappers
    -   **Dependencies**: Enhance Modularity and Separation of Concerns.

### Security & Robustness

-   **[Enhancement]**: Bolster Security Practices (Dependency Audit, Secure File Handling)
    -   **Complexity**: Medium
    -   **Rationale**: Aligns with "Security Considerations" and Rust Appendix (`cargo audit`). Proactively addresses security, ensures supply chain integrity, and improves robustness of file operations.
    -   **Expected Outcome**:
        -   `cargo audit` integrated into the CI pipeline (covered by "Implement CI Pipeline").
        -   All file path constructions use `std::path::PathBuf` for cross-platform compatibility and safety.
        -   Application robustly checks for and creates the notes directory (`std::fs::create_dir_all`) if it doesn't exist before attempting file operations.
        -   Defensive handling and validation of critical environment variables (e.g., `HOME`, `EDITOR`, `PONDER_DIR`).
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Add cargo-audit to CI pipeline
        - Review and fix file path handling
        - Add directory existence checks/creation
        - Implement validation for environment variables
    -   **Dependencies**: Implement CI Pipeline for Automated Checks.

-   **[Enhancement]**: Implement Custom `Debug` for Sensitive Structs & Secure Logging
    -   **Complexity**: Medium
    -   **Rationale**: Aligns with "Logging Strategy" ("What NOT to Log") and "Security Considerations". Prevents accidental leakage of sensitive data (paths, editor commands, config values) in logs.
    -   **Expected Outcome**: Structs like `CliArgs`, `Config`, and any error types containing paths or commands have custom `std::fmt::Debug` implementations that redact or summarize sensitive fields. Logs are reviewed to ensure no PII or sensitive operational data is inadvertently exposed.
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Identify structs containing potentially sensitive data
        - Implement custom Debug trait for these structs
        - Ensure path information is redacted/sanitized
        - Test logging to verify sensitive data is properly handled
        - Document approach for future struct additions
    -   **Dependencies**: Implement Structured, Contextual Logging with `tracing`.

### Documentation & Developer Experience

-   **[Enhancement]**: Improve Code and Project Documentation (Comprehensive)
    -   **Complexity**: Medium
    -   **Rationale**: Aligns with "Documentation Approach" philosophy. Essential for maintainability, onboarding new contributors, and user adoption.
    -   **Expected Outcome**:
        -   `README.md`: Fully updated per Dev Philosophy (Title, Purpose, Badges, Features, Installation, Build, Test, Usage, Configuration, Architecture, Contributing, License).
        -   `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Created, detailing development workflow, coding style, testing strategy, and pull request process.
        -   Rustdoc comments (`///`) for all public API elements (modules, functions, structs, enums, traits).
        -   Inline comments (`//`) explaining "the why" for non-obvious logic or important decisions.
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Update README.md with comprehensive sections
        - Create CONTRIBUTING.md with workflow guidelines
        - Add rustdoc comments to public APIs
        - Add inline comments for non-obvious logic
    -   **Dependencies**: Enhance Modularity and Separation of Concerns.

-   **[Enhancement]**: Adopt Conventional Commits and Automate Changelog Generation
    -   **Complexity**: Medium
    -   **Rationale**: Aligns with "Semantic Versioning and Release Automation" philosophy. Improves commit history readability and enables automated changelog generation and versioning.
    -   **Expected Outcome**: Project adopts Conventional Commits standard. Commit message linting (e.g., `commitlint`) integrated into pre-commit hooks. Tooling (e.g., `git-cliff` or `standard-version`) configured to generate/update `CHANGELOG.md` from commit history.
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Add commitlint configuration
        - Document commit message standards
        - Setup automated versioning based on commits
        - Configure CHANGELOG generation
    -   **Dependencies**: Setup Local Pre-commit Hooks.

### Code Quality & Maintainability

-   **[Fix]**: Awkward Test-Only Public Struct Fields and Public Methods
    -   **Complexity**: Medium
    -   **Rationale**: Making fields and methods conditionally public with `#[cfg(test)] pub` complicates the API, exposes internals unnecessarily, and can be avoided with better test design.
    -   **Expected Outcome**: Cleaner API without test-only public fields/methods. Test-specific functionality (e.g., `Config::default()` for tests) moved to appropriate test modules or test helper functions.
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Remove `#[cfg(test)] pub(crate) config: Config` field from `JournalService`
        - Move test-only parsing/validation logic into dedicated test modules
        - Replace `Config::new()` with `Config::default()` in tests
        - Move test-only convenience methods into appropriate test modules
    -   **Dependencies**: Replace Mock-Based Internal Tests with Behavior-Driven Integration Tests.

-   **[Fix]**: Fragile `Clone` Implementation for `AppError::Io`
    -   **Complexity**: Medium
    -   **Rationale**: The current manual `Clone` implementation for `AppError::Io` is lossy. Error details should be preserved if cloning is necessary, or cloning should be reconsidered.
    -   **Expected Outcome**: `AppError::Io` correctly handles cloning (e.g., by storing `io::ErrorKind` and a `String` message, or wrapping the original `std::io::Error` in an `Arc` if full fidelity is needed and cloning `AppError` is essential). Alternatively, `AppError` no longer derives `Clone` if not truly required.
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Evaluate if `AppError` genuinely needs to be `Clone`
        - Consider wrapping `std::io::Error` in an `Arc` for efficient, non-lossy cloning
        - Or store only the needed error components directly
    -   **Dependencies**: Standardize Error Handling, Eliminate Panics, and Prevent Double Logging.

-   **[Refactor]**: Replace Magic Strings and Numbers with Constants
    -   **Complexity**: Simple
    -   **Rationale**: Improves code readability, maintainability, and reduces the risk of typos or inconsistencies by using named constants.
    -   **Expected Outcome**: Key literal values (e.g., default editor name, directory names, file extensions, reminisce default offsets) are defined as well-named constants in appropriate scopes (e.g., a `constants.rs` module or within relevant modules).
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Identify magic constants and strings
        - Create appropriately scoped constants
        - Replace literals with constants throughout the code
        - Document constants where appropriate
    -   **Dependencies**: Enhance Modularity and Separation of Concerns (provides logical places for constants).

## Low Priority

### Usability Enhancements & Minor Features

-   **[Feature]**: Journaling Templates
    -   **Complexity**: Medium
    -   **Rationale**: Improves user efficiency and consistency for structured entries (User Value Prioritization #4).
    -   **Expected Outcome**: Users can define text-based templates (e.g., stored in the Ponder configuration directory). A CLI option (e.g., `ponder new --template <template_name>`) populates the new journal entry with the content of the specified template.
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Define template format and storage location
        - Add template loading functionality
        - Update CLI to include template options
        - Add documentation for templates feature
    -   **Dependencies**: Implement Externalized Configuration Management.

-   **[Feature]**: Enhanced Reminisce Mode with Configurable Intervals
    -   **Complexity**: Medium
    -   **Rationale**: Increases user value by making the "reminisce" feature more flexible and powerful, allowing users to tailor it to their preferred reflection cadences (User Value Prioritization #4).
    -   **Expected Outcome**: Users can configure reminisce intervals (e.g., "1 week ago", "1 month ago", "3 months ago", "1 year ago") via CLI options or the configuration file. The tool can open multiple past entries if they exist for the specified intervals.
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Add configuration options for reminisce intervals
        - Modify reminisce logic to use configured intervals
        - Update CLI to support interval customization
        - Document reminisce configuration options
    -   **Dependencies**: Implement Externalized Configuration Management.

### Code Quality & Developer Experience

-   **[Enhancement]**: Specify Rust Edition and MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version) in `Cargo.toml` & CI
    -   **Complexity**: Simple
    -   **Rationale**: Aligns with Rust Appendix (Tooling and Environment). Clearly defines the project's language features and supported Rust versions, ensuring build consistency for contributors.
    -   **Expected Outcome**: `Cargo.toml` explicitly defines the `edition` (e.g., "2021") and `rust-version` (e.g., "1.70"). CI includes a job that builds/tests using this specific MSRV.
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Define MSRV in `Cargo.toml` using `rust-version` field
        - Add CI job using the specified MSRV toolchain
    -   **Dependencies**: Implement CI Pipeline for Automated Checks.

-   **[Enhancement]**: Enforce File and Function Length Guidelines
    -   **Complexity**: Simple
    -   **Rationale**: Aligns with Dev Philosophy ("Adhere to Length Guidelines", "Maintainability"). Promotes better code organization, readability, and discourages overly complex components.
    -   **Expected Outcome**: `clippy.toml` configured to warn on functions exceeding a defined line limit (e.g., 100 lines) and files exceeding another limit (e.g., 500 lines). These checks are part of the CI linting stage. Existing violations are identified for refactoring.
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Configure linter to warn at 500 lines for files
        - Configure linter to warn at 100 lines for functions
        - Integrate with CI pipeline
        - Refactor any existing violations
    -   **Dependencies**: Enforce Strict Code Linting.

-   **[Refactor]**: Review and Minimize Crate Dependencies
    -   **Complexity**: Medium
    -   **Rationale**: Aligns with "Disciplined Dependency Management" philosophy. Reduces build times, binary size, attack surface, and cognitive load.
    -   **Expected Outcome**: Unused or unnecessary dependencies are removed. Remaining dependencies are audited for necessity and security. Tools like `cargo-machete` or `cargo-udeps` may be used for auditing.
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Audit all direct dependencies in Cargo.toml
        - Remove unused dependencies
        - Consider consolidating dependencies with overlapping functionality
        - Document why each dependency is needed
        - Configure cargo-audit to check for vulnerabilities
    -   **Dependencies**: None.

### Minor Cleanups & Refinements

-   **[Fix]**: Redundancy: Unnecessary Wrapper for `CliArgs::parse_from`
    -   **Complexity**: Simple
    -   **Rationale**: The `CliArgs::parse()` method is a thin wrapper around functionality already provided by `clap::Parser::parse_from` (or `CliArgs::parse()` if `derive(Parser)` is used). This adds an unnecessary layer.
    -   **Expected Outcome**: Simplified code using the derived `CliArgs::parse()` method (from `clap::Parser`) directly in `main.rs`.
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Remove custom `CliArgs::parse()` method
        - Use the method derived by `clap::Parser` in `main.rs`
    -   **Dependencies**: None.

-   **[Fix]**: Update Copyright Year in LICENSE File
    -   **Complexity**: Simple
    -   **Rationale**: General project maintenance to keep legal information current.
    -   **Expected Outcome**: The LICENSE file reflects the correct current year or range of years.
    -   **Implementation Steps**:
        - Update copyright year to current year
        - Verify copyright holder information is accurate
        - Consider using a date range format (e.g., "2023-2025")
    -   **Dependencies**: None.

-   **[Fix]**: Audit for `unsafe` Code Blocks and Ensure Compliance with Safety Philosophy
    -   **Complexity**: Simple
    -   **Rationale**: Aligns with Rust Appendix ("Unsafe Code"). Ensures any use of `unsafe` is absolutely necessary, minimal, and thoroughly justified and documented.
    -   **Expected Outcome**: Codebase is audited for `unsafe` blocks. Any `unsafe` block is necessary, its scope is minimized, and it's documented with a `// SAFETY: ...` comment explaining why it's safe and correct.
