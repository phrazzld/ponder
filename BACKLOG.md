## Now (Sprint-Ready, <2 weeks)

### Security Track (v2.0.1 - This Week)

**Context**: 4 P1 items from PR #50 review - non-blocking quality improvements that should ship quickly after v2.0 merge.

#### [Security] Add Passphrase Strength Validation
**File**: src/crypto/session.rs:218
**Impact**: Users can create weak passphrases that undermine encryption
**Fix**: Minimum 12 characters, check against common weak passwords
**Effort**: 45min | **Value**: HIGH - Standard security practice

#### [Security] Guard Test Passphrase Env Var
**File**: src/crypto/session.rs:273
**Impact**: PONDER_TEST_PASSPHRASE bypass accessible in production
**Fix**: Wrap in `#[cfg(test)]`
**Effort**: 5min | **Value**: MEDIUM - Defense in depth

#### [Documentation] Add Passphrase Recovery Warning
**File**: README.md
**Impact**: Users unaware that forgotten passphrase = permanent data loss
**Fix**: Add prominent security notice explaining zero-knowledge encryption
**Effort**: 15min | **Value**: CRITICAL - Prevents support burden

#### [UX] Add Passphrase Retry Logic
**File**: src/main.rs command handlers
**Impact**: Wrong passphrase fails immediately (inconsistent with sudo/SSH)
**Fix**: Allow 3 attempts with clear feedback
**Effort**: 30min | **Value**: MEDIUM - Standard UX pattern

**Total Security Track**: 1.5 hours

---

### Code Quality Track (Top 3 from Comprehensive Review)

#### [Reliability] Add Connection Timeout to Database Pool
**File**: src/db/mod.rs:79
**Issue**: Pool can hang indefinitely if connections exhausted
**Fix**: `.connection_timeout(Duration::from_secs(30))`
**Effort**: 5min | **Value**: Production hardening

#### [Reliability] Panic-Safe Temp File Cleanup
**File**: src/ops/ask.rs, search.rs, reflect.rs, reindex.rs
**Issue**: `let _ = fs::remove_file()` doesn't guarantee cleanup on panic
**Fix**: Use Drop guard or tempfile::NamedTempFile
**Effort**: 2h | **Value**: Prevents temp file leaks

#### [Architecture] Schema Migration Framework
**File**: src/db/mod.rs:174-196
**Issue**: Code tracks schema version but has no upgrade mechanism
**Fix**: Implement migration runner before v2.0.1 schema changes
**Effort**: 4h | **Value**: HIGH - Critical for maintainability

**Total Code Quality**: 6h

---

### Product Track (v2.1 - Parallel, Starting Next Week)

#### [PRODUCT] Export Functionality
**Scope**: Multi-format export (markdown, PDF, JSON)
**Business Case**: **ADOPTION BLOCKER** - Removes #1 objection ("What if I want to switch later?")
**Competitive Gap**: Day One, Obsidian, jrnl all have export - Ponder has NONE
**User Value**: Removes vendor lock-in perception, enables sharing, professional/academic use
**Implementation**:
```bash
ponder export --format markdown --output ~/journal-export/
ponder export --format pdf --date 2024-01-15
ponder export --format json --from 2024-01-01 --to 2024-12-31
```
**Effort**: 5 days | **Strategic Value**: CRITICAL - table stakes feature
**Priority**: NOW - should be in v2.1

#### [PRODUCT] Templates System
**Scope**: Pre-defined prompts for structured journaling
**Business Case**: **ADOPTION DRIVER** + **RETENTION HOOK**
**Market Gap**: Day One (50+ templates), Notion, Obsidian all have this
**User Value**: Eliminates blank page anxiety, drives daily habit formation
**Implementation**:
```bash
ponder edit --template daily-reflection
ponder edit --template gratitude
export PONDER_TEMPLATE=~/.ponder/templates/custom.md
```
**Effort**: 6 days | **Strategic Value**: HIGH - lowers entry barrier
**Priority**: NOW - v2.1 alongside export

**Total Product Track**: 11 days (2 week sprint)

## Next (This Quarter, <3 months)

### High-Impact Features (Adoption + Retention)

#### [PRODUCT] Import from Competitors
**Scope**: One-click migration from Day One, Obsidian, jrnl, Standard Notes
**Business Case**: **ADOPTION DRIVER** - expands addressable market 10x (existing journalers vs only new)
**Competitive Impact**: Enables competitive displacement, easy to switch TO Ponder
**Effort**: 8 days | **Strategic Value**: HIGH - converts competitor users

#### [UX] Ollama Onboarding Guidance
**Impact**: First-time users hit confusing "Ollama not found" errors with no context
**Fix**: Pre-flight check before passphrase prompt, clear installation instructions
**Effort**: 4h | **Value**: CRITICAL - prevents immediate abandonment

#### [UX] Progress Indicators for Long Operations
**Impact**: Users think app is frozen during 5-30s embedding/LLM operations
**Fix**: Show "Generating embeddings... [5/15] 33%" with progress bar
**Effort**: 3h | **Value**: HIGH - prevents perceived freezes

#### [UX] Session Timeout Improvements
**Impact**: Silent lock after 30min with cryptic error, user loses context
**Fix**: Show remaining time after operations, clearer lock messages
**Effort**: 2h | **Value**: MEDIUM-HIGH - reduces interruption frustration

---

### Performance Optimization

#### [PERFORMANCE] Vector Search Optimization (10-100x speedup)
**File**: src/db/embeddings.rs:136-190
**Issue**: O(n) full table scan - slow with 1000+ entries
**Options**:
1. Implement ANN indexing (HNSW) - 16h, 100x speedup
2. Add date range filtering - 3h, 10x for windowed queries
3. Pre-filter + optimize - 2h, 5x quick win
**Effort**: 2-16h depending on approach | **Value**: CRITICAL at scale
**Recommendation**: Start with date range filtering (3h), add ANN in v2.2

#### [PERFORMANCE] Parallel Decryption in RAG/Search
**File**: src/ops/ask.rs, search.rs
**Issue**: Serial decryption of 5 entries = 250-500ms blocking
**Fix**: Use Rayon for parallel decryption (3-5x speedup on multi-core)
**Effort**: 6h | **Value**: HIGH - better responsiveness

---

### Architecture Refactoring

#### [ARCHITECTURE] Extract ApplicationOrchestrator from main.rs
**File**: src/main.rs:81-704
**Issue**: God object - 11 command handlers duplicating boilerplate
**Fix**: Extract CommandContext for unified initialization
**Effort**: 6h | **Impact**: Eliminates 100+ lines duplication, enables middleware

## Learnings

**From this grooming session (2025-10-27)**:

### Multi-Perspective Insights
- **Architecture**: main.rs god object and database boundary violations are highest-leverage refactorings
- **Security**: Strong overall posture (7.2/10), no CRITICAL vulnerabilities, focus on passphrase handling
- **Performance**: Vector search O(n) is critical bottleneck - will block scale beyond 1000 entries
- **UX**: Ollama onboarding and progress indicators are adoption blockers (first-time user experience)
- **Product**: Export is #1 missing feature across ALL competitive comparisons

### Cross-Perspective Validation
Items flagged by 3+ agents indicate fundamental issues:
- Pass-through wrapper (complexity + architecture + maintainability) → confirmed shallow module
- Missing export (UX + product) → confirmed adoption blocker
- Vector search performance (performance + product at scale) → confirmed scalability limit

### Pruning Decisions
Deleted 45 items (75% reduction):
- All completed/archived sections (belong in git history, not backlog)
- 30+ low-priority technical debt items (nice-to-haves, not business-critical)
- 7 items from comprehensive review (kept only top 3 highest-impact)
- Duplicate/overlapping items merged

### Strategic Insights
**80/20 Rule Applied**:
- Top 20% of items (export, templates, import, mobile, AI insights) drive 80% of adoption/retention/differentiation
- Security items are hygiene factors (must fix) but not adoption drivers
- Performance matters at scale, but not for first 500 users

**Parallel Tracks Work**:
- Security (1.5h) and Product (11 days) can run simultaneously
- Different skill sets, different PR flows, no blocking dependencies

**What Makes Users Choose Ponder?**
1. Privacy (local-first + encryption) ← already strong
2. AI features (semantic search + insights) ← unique, but needs polish
3. Interoperability (export/import, git-friendly) ← CRITICAL GAP

**What Makes Users Never Leave?**
1. Habit formation (streaks, reminders, templates) ← next priority
2. Mobile access (can't journal on-the-go = churn) ← must have by Month 6
3. Historical value (years of entries = switching cost) ← export reduces this
4. Platform effects (plugins, workflows) ← long-term moat
