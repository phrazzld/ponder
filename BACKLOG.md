## High Priority

### Testing & Code Quality Issues

- **[Fix]**: Test Strategy: Violation of Mocking Policy and Over-Reliance on Internal Mocks
  - **Complexity**: Complex
  - **Rationale**: The current testing strategy for `JournalService` relies heavily on mocking internal collaborators like `Editor` and `JournalIO`, violating the development philosophy. Tests are coupled to implementation details rather than observable behavior.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Refactored `JournalService` with more pure, easily testable logic. Integration tests using real or in-memory implementations where possible. Mocks reserved only for true external boundaries.
  - **Implementation Steps**:
    - Refactor `JournalService` to extract more pure logic
    - Implement real or in-memory filesystem implementations for `JournalIO`
    - Redesign tests to focus on observable behavior
    - Reserve mocks only for true external boundaries

- **[Fix]**: Security: Inadequate Log Redaction for Sensitive Information
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Logging full `CliArgs` and `Config` at DEBUG level can leak potentially sensitive information, violating the logging guidelines in the development philosophy.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Safe `Debug` implementations for `CliArgs` and `Config` that redact or summarize sensitive fields. Careful consideration of what paths and commands are logged.
  - **Implementation Steps**:
    - Implement custom `Debug` formatting for sensitive structs
    - Redact or summarize sensitive fields
    - Log only specific, non-sensitive fields instead of entire structures

- **[Fix]**: Observability: Missing Mandatory Context Fields in Structured Logs
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Structured logs are missing required context fields like `service_name`, `correlation_id`, and `module/function`, hampering log analysis and debugging.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Enhanced logging setup with all mandatory context fields included in every log entry.
  - **Implementation Steps**:
    - Add static `service_name` to logs
    - Generate and include `correlation_id` for each invocation
    - Include `module_path` and line numbers in logs
    - Ensure `error_details` are captured for ERROR level logs

- **[Fix]**: Error Handling: Inconsistent Error Propagation and Context
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Errors are logged at lower levels and then propagated, leading to potential double logging and cluttered logs. The context added via logging is not part of the error value itself.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Consistent error propagation without intermediate logging. Better error context through enhanced error types. A single, comprehensive logging point for unhandled errors.
  - **Implementation Steps**:
    - Remove intermediate logging within `.map_err` blocks
    - Use `context` methods from crates like `anyhow` for better error context
    - Establish a single logging point for unhandled errors
    - Handle potential `env_logger::init()` errors

### Developer Workflow & Automation

- **[Enhancement]**: Implement CI Pipeline for Automated Checks
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Aligns with Dev Philosophy (Automation, Quality Gates, CI/CD). Ensures consistent code quality, catches regressions early, automates repetitive tasks (formatting, linting, testing), and provides rapid feedback. Critical for maintaining a healthy codebase and enabling confident development.
  - **Updates Needed**: 
    - Add test coverage enforcement using `cargo-tarpaulin` or similar tool
    - Add dependency vulnerability scanning with `cargo audit`
    - Fail build on coverage drops or security vulnerabilities
  - **Expected Outcome**: A fully automated CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) that runs on every push and pull request, executing checks for code formatting (`cargo fmt --check`), strict linting (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`), automated tests (`cargo test --all-features`), and dependency vulnerability scanning (`cargo audit`). Builds fail on any violation.
  - **Implementation Steps**:
    - Create `.github/workflows` directory
    - Create CI workflow file for running on push and pull requests
    - Configure tests to run in CI
    - Configure linters and type checking
    - Set up test coverage reporting
    - Add build status badge to README.md
  - **Dependencies**: Enforce Consistent Code Formatting, Enforce Strict Code Linting, Implement Comprehensive Automated Testing Strategy, Bolster Security Practices (for audit).

- **[Enhancement]**: Setup Local Pre-commit Hooks
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Rationale**: Aligns with Dev Philosophy (Automation, Quality Gates). Catches formatting and linting issues locally before commit, reducing CI failures, developer friction, and ensuring consistency.
  - **Expected Outcome**: A pre-commit framework (e.g., `pre-commit` with `husky` or similar) configured to automatically run `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, and `cargo check` locally before each commit. Commits are blocked if hooks fail.
  - **Implementation Steps**:
    - Install pre-commit framework
    - Configure linting and formatting checks
    - Add type checking
    - Prevent commit of sensitive data and large files
    - Enforce conventional commit format
    - Configure post-commit hooks for documentation generation
    - Configure pre-push hooks to run complete test suite and enforce branch naming conventions
  - **Dependencies**: Enforce Consistent Code Formatting, Enforce Strict Code Linting.

- **[Enhancement]**: Enforce Consistent Code Formatting (`rustfmt`)
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Rationale**: Aligns with Dev Philosophy (Code Quality, Maintainability) and Rust Appendix (Tooling). Ensures a consistent code style, significantly improving readability, reducing cognitive load, and minimizing stylistic debates.
  - **Expected Outcome**: All code in the repository is formatted according to `rustfmt` standards. `cargo fmt --check` passes in CI and pre-commit hooks. A `.rustfmt.toml` configuration file is present if non-default settings are used.
  - **Dependencies**: Implement CI Pipeline, Setup Local Pre-commit Hooks.

- **[Enhancement]**: Enforce Strict Code Linting (`clippy`)
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Rationale**: Aligns with Dev Philosophy (Code Quality, Maintainability, Error Handling) and Rust Appendix (Clippy usage). Catches common Rust anti-patterns, potential bugs, and style issues, improving code quality and robustness.
  - **Expected Outcome**: `clippy` is configured for strictness (e.g., `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` or via `Cargo.toml`/`clippy.toml`). All `clippy` checks pass in CI and pre-commit hooks.
  - **Dependencies**: Implement CI Pipeline, Setup Local Pre-commit Hooks.

### Code Quality & Architecture

- **[Enhancement]**: Implement File Length Enforcement
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Rationale**: Aligns with Dev Philosophy (Code Quality, Maintainability). Long files are harder to understand, maintain, and often violate the single responsibility principle. Setting reasonable length limits encourages better code organization.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Tooling in place to flag files that exceed reasonable length limits. Linting configuration that warns at 500 lines and errors at 1000 lines.
  - **Implementation Steps**:
    - Configure linter (e.g., clippy or custom tool) to warn at 500 lines
    - Configure error at 1000 lines
    - Integrate with CI pipeline
  - **Dependencies**: Implement CI Pipeline.

- **[Refactor]**: Improve Error Handling and Eliminate Panics
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Aligns with Dev Philosophy (Error Handling, Robustness) and Rust Appendix (Result, no panics for recoverable errors). Current `unwrap()`/`expect()` usage leads to fragile application behavior. Replacing these with proper `Result` propagation is critical for application stability and user experience.
  - **Expected Outcome**: All `unwrap()` and `expect()` calls on `Result` and `Option` types in recoverable code paths are replaced with robust error handling (e.g., `?` operator, `match`, `if let`). Custom error types (e.g., using `thiserror`) are introduced for better error context. `main` function returns a `Result` and prints user-friendly error messages.
  - **Dependencies**: None.

- **[Refactor]**: Enhance Modularity and Separation of Concerns
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Aligns with Dev Philosophy (Modularity, Separation of Concerns). The current single-file structure (as per `glance.md`) mixes CLI parsing, file I/O, date logic, and process execution, hindering testability and maintainability.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Application logic is extracted from `main.rs` into well-defined modules (e.g., `src/cli.rs`, `src/journal.rs`, `src/config.rs`, `src/errors.rs`). Each module has clear responsibilities and a well-defined public API. `main.rs` becomes a thin orchestrator.
  - **Dependencies**: None (but facilitates testing and error handling improvements).

### Testing & Verification

- **[Enhancement]**: Implement Comprehensive Automated Testing Strategy
  - **Complexity**: Complex
  - **Rationale**: Aligns with Dev Philosophy (Design for Testability, Testing Strategy). Lack of automated tests (as noted in `glance.md`) makes changes risky and hinders refactoring. A robust testing strategy is fundamental for verifying correctness, preventing regressions, and enabling safe code evolution.
  - **Expected Outcome**:
    - Unit tests for core logic (e.g., date calculations, filename generation, helper functions) using `#[cfg(test)]` modules.
    - Integration tests in the `tests/` directory simulating CLI execution (e.g., using `assert_cmd`, `tempfile`) and verifying file system interactions for all commands and options.
    - Doc tests (`///`) for public API elements.
    - `cargo test --all-features` integrated into the CI pipeline.
    - Initial test coverage reporting established (e.g., using `cargo-tarpaulin`), aiming for a meaningful baseline (e.g., >80%).
  - **Dependencies**: Enhance Modularity and Separation of Concerns (makes unit testing easier), Implement CI Pipeline.

## Medium Priority

### Code Architecture & Design

- **[Fix]**: API Design: Awkward Test-Only Struct Fields and Public Methods
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Making fields and methods conditionally public with `#[cfg(test)]` complicates the API and exposes internals unnecessarily.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Cleaner API without test-only public fields. Test-specific functionality moved to appropriate test modules.
  - **Implementation Steps**:
    - Remove `#[cfg(test)] pub(crate) config: Config` field from `JournalService`
    - Move test-only parsing/validation logic into dedicated test modules
    - Replace `Config::new()` with `Config::default()` in tests
    - Move test-only convenience methods into appropriate test modules

- **[Fix]**: Modularity: Misplaced CLI Argument Interpretation Logic
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Rationale**: Logic for interpreting `CliArgs` and converting to `DateSpecifier` is in `main.rs` but should be in the `cli` module.
  - **Expected Outcome**: `get_date_specifier_from_args` and related logic moved to the appropriate module.
  - **Implementation Steps**:
    - Move logic to `src/cli/mod.rs`
    - Consider making it a method on `CliArgs`
    - Update all call sites

- **[Fix]**: Error Design: Fragile `Clone` Implementation for `AppError::Io`
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: The manual `Clone` implementation for `AppError::Io` is lossy and discards potentially valuable error details.
  - **Expected Outcome**: A more robust error design that preserves error details when cloned.
  - **Implementation Steps**:
    - Evaluate if `AppError` genuinely needs to be `Clone`
    - Consider wrapping `std::io::Error` in an `Arc` for efficient, non-lossy cloning
    - Or store only the needed error components directly

- **[Enhancement]**: Missing MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version) Enforcement
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Rationale**: Without an explicitly defined and CI-enforced MSRV, contributors might use newer Rust features, breaking compatibility.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Defined MSRV in `Cargo.toml` and CI enforcement of this version.
  - **Implementation Steps**:
    - Define MSRV in `Cargo.toml` using `rust-version` field
    - Add CI job using the specified MSRV toolchain

### Configuration & Usability

- **[Feature]**: Implement Externalized Configuration Management
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Aligns with Dev Philosophy (Configuration Management). Hardcoded paths and reliance solely on `$EDITOR` (per `glance.md`) limit user flexibility. Externalized configuration improves usability and adaptability.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Journal directory path, default editor fallback, and potentially other settings (e.g., date formats) are configurable via environment variables (e.g., `PONDER_DIR`) and/or a configuration file (e.g., XDG compliant `~/.config/ponder/config.toml`). Sensible defaults are used if no configuration is found. Configuration loading logic is centralized and documented.
  - **Dependencies**: Enhance Modularity and Separation of Concerns.

- **[Enhancement]**: Improve CLI Argument Parsing and Help Messages
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Rationale**: Clear and helpful CLI is essential for usability and discoverability of features, directly impacting user satisfaction.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Review and enhance `clap` struct definitions for clarity and consistency. Ensure all options and subcommands have comprehensive, user-friendly help messages. Add examples to help text where appropriate. Standardize argument naming conventions.
  - **Dependencies**: None.

### Security & Robustness

- **[Enhancement]**: Bolster Security Practices
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Aligns with Dev Philosophy (Security Considerations) and Rust Appendix (`cargo audit`). Proactively addresses security, ensures supply chain integrity, and improves robustness of file operations.
  - **Expected Outcome**:
    - `cargo audit` integrated into the CI pipeline to scan for dependency vulnerabilities, failing the build on high/critical issues.
    - All file path constructions use `std::path::PathBuf` for cross-platform compatibility and safety.
    - Application robustly checks for and creates the notes directory (`std::fs::create_dir_all`) if it doesn't exist before attempting file operations.
    - Defensive handling and validation of critical environment variables (e.g., `HOME`, `EDITOR`).
  - **Dependencies**: Implement CI Pipeline.

### Documentation & Developer Experience

- **[Enhancement]**: Improve Code and Project Documentation
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Aligns with Dev Philosophy (Documentation Approach). Comprehensive documentation is vital for maintainability, onboarding new contributors (human or AI), and user adoption.
  - **Expected Outcome**:
    - Rustdoc comments (`///`) added to all public functions, structs, enums, and modules.
    - Inline comments (`//`) explain non-obvious logic ("the why").
    - `README.md` expanded with detailed installation instructions, build steps, comprehensive usage examples for all CLI options, configuration details, and a brief architecture overview.
    - `CONTRIBUTING.md` created, detailing the development workflow, code style, testing requirements, and pull request process.
  - **Implementation Steps**:
    - Comprehensive README.md with:
      - Project description and purpose
      - Features list
      - Installation instructions
      - Usage examples with code
      - Development setup guide
      - Contribution guidelines
    - Verify MIT LICENSE file has correct year and copyright holder
    - Create CONTRIBUTING.md with:
      - Development workflow documentation
      - Branch and PR conventions
      - Code style and testing requirements
  - **Dependencies**: Enhance Modularity and Separation of Concerns (documentation is easier with clear modules).

- **[Enhancement]**: Adopt Conventional Commits and Automate Changelog Generation
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Rationale**: Aligns with Dev Philosophy (Semantic Versioning, Automation). Standardized commit messages improve project history readability and enable automated changelog generation, streamlining the release process.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Project adopts the Conventional Commits specification. Commit message linting (e.g., `commitlint`) is integrated into pre-commit hooks or CI. Tooling (e.g., `git-cliff`) is implemented to automatically generate/update `CHANGELOG.md` from commit messages.
  - **Implementation Steps**:
    - Add commitlint configuration
    - Document commit message standards
    - Setup automated versioning based on commits
    - Configure CHANGELOG generation
  - **Dependencies**: Implement CI Pipeline, Setup Local Pre-commit Hooks.

- **[Enhancement]**: Specify Rust Edition and MSRV in `Cargo.toml`
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Rationale**: Aligns with Rust Appendix (Tooling and Environment). Clearly defines the project's language features and supported Rust versions, improving clarity for contributors and ensuring build consistency.
  - **Expected Outcome**: `Cargo.toml` explicitly defines the Rust edition (e.g., `edition = "2021"`) and a Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is documented and potentially enforced in CI.
  - **Dependencies**: None.

### Code Quality & Maintainability

- **[Refactor]**: Replace Magic Strings and Numbers with Constants
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Rationale**: Aligns with Dev Philosophy (Code Quality, Maintainability). Using named constants instead of literal "magic" values improves code readability, maintainability, and reduces the risk of typos or inconsistent behavior.
  - **Expected Outcome**: All magic values (e.g., fallback editor name, `RETRO_DAYS_OFFSET`, reminisce intervals) are replaced with well-named constants, defined at an appropriate scope (e.g., within a `constants` module or relevant configuration struct).
  - **Dependencies**: Enhance Modularity and Separation of Concerns (provides logical places for constants).

### Observability & Logging

- **[Enhancement]**: Implement Structured Logging
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Aligns with Dev Philosophy (Logging Strategy, Structured Logging) and Rust Appendix (log/tracing). `println!` is insufficient for operational logging. Structured logging improves debuggability and observability, especially for errors and complex application flows.
  - **Expected Outcome**: The `log` crate facade (or `tracing`) is adopted. A logging implementation (e.g., `env_logger`, `fern`, `tracing-subscriber`) is configured, potentially outputting JSON in CI/production environments. Log levels are configurable (e.g., via `RUST_LOG`). Key events, errors, and decisions are logged with appropriate context.
  - **Dependencies**: Improve Error Handling (structured logs are excellent for reporting errors).

## Low Priority

### Code Cleanup & Refinements

- **[Fix]**: Redundancy: Unnecessary Wrapper for `CliArgs::parse_from`
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Rationale**: The `CliArgs::parse()` method is a thin wrapper around functionality already provided by `clap::Parser`. This adds an unnecessary layer.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Simplified code using the derived `CliArgs::parse()` method directly.
  - **Implementation Steps**:
    - Remove custom `CliArgs::parse()` method
    - Use the method derived by `clap::Parser` in `main.rs`

- **[Fix]**: Clarity: Magic Constants for Reminisce Intervals
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Rationale**: Magic constants for reminisce intervals could be better co-located or encapsulated for improved context.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Constants grouped within a more specific scope for better context.
  - **Implementation Steps**:
    - Group constants within a private `reminisce_intervals` module
    - Or move them directly within the `get_dates` method if not used elsewhere

- **[Fix]**: Linting: Redundant `clippy.toml` Deny List Entries
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Rationale**: Several entries in the clippy deny list are redundant as they're covered by `clippy::all`.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Simplified `clippy.toml` with focused deny list.
  - **Implementation Steps**:
    - Simplify the deny list to primarily use `clippy::all`
    - Only explicitly list lints not covered by `clippy::all` or needing emphasis

- **[Fix]**: Test Hygiene: Unnecessary `#[allow(dead_code)]` in Mock Editor
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Rationale**: Methods marked with `#[allow(dead_code)]` are actually used in tests, making the attributes unnecessary and misleading.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Clean code without unnecessary attributes.
  - **Implementation Steps**:
    - Remove the `#[allow(dead_code)]` attributes from the methods

- **[Enhancement]**: Documentation: Incomplete README for Core Developer Workflow
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Rationale**: The README lacks critical information for contributors regarding local development and quality checks.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Enhanced README with comprehensive information for contributors.
  - **Implementation Steps**:
    - Add instructions for running all automated tests
    - Add instructions for running linters and format checks
    - Add a CI status badge

### Core Application Logic

- **[Feature]**: Enhanced Reminisce Mode with Configurable Intervals
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Increases user value by making the "reminisce" feature more flexible and powerful, allowing users to tailor it to their preferred reflection cadences.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Users can configure reminisce intervals (e.g., 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 1 year ago) via CLI options or the configuration file. The tool can open multiple past entries if they exist for the specified intervals.
  - **Dependencies**: Implement Externalized Configuration Management.

- **[Feature]**: Journaling Templates
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Improves user efficiency and consistency for structured journal entries (e.g., daily stand-ups, gratitude logs, decision records).
  - **Expected Outcome**: Users can define simple text templates (e.g., stored in the configuration directory). A CLI option (e.g., `ponder new --template <n>`) populates the new journal entry with the content of the specified template.
  - **Dependencies**: Implement Externalized Configuration Management.

### Research & Innovation

- **[Research]**: Explore Async Rust for I/O Operations
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Investigate potential performance/responsiveness benefits of asynchronous I/O for file operations, especially if Ponder were to handle larger files, a higher volume of notes, or integrate network-based features in the future. This aligns with exploring technical excellence while avoiding premature optimization.
  - **Expected Outcome**: A research spike report summarizing findings on whether async Rust (e.g., Tokio) would provide tangible benefits for Ponder's current and foreseeable scope, versus the added complexity.
  - **Dependencies**: None.

- **[Research]**: Explore Cross-Platform Compatibility Enhancements
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: While Rust offers good cross-platform support, proactively investigating and addressing potential edge cases (e.g., path differences, editor launching nuances, specific OS APIs) ensures a smoother experience for users on all major platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows).
  - **Expected Outcome**: A report identifying potential cross-platform compatibility issues and best practices for mitigating them. Testing strategy expanded to cover multiple OS environments if feasible.
  - **Dependencies**: Implement Comprehensive Automated Testing Strategy.

### Release Management

- **[Enhancement]**: Automate Release Process (Semantic Release)
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Aligns with Dev Philosophy (Automation, Semantic Versioning). Streamlines the release process, ensures consistent versioning based on commit history, and reduces manual effort and potential for error.
  - **Expected Outcome**: A fully automated release process (e.g., using GitHub Actions with tools compatible with Conventional Commits) that triggers on merges to the main branch, automatically bumps the version, creates Git tags, generates release notes, and potentially publishes release artifacts (e.g., to GitHub Releases).
  - **Dependencies**: Adopt Conventional Commits and Automate Changelog Generation, Implement CI Pipeline.

## Future Considerations

### Advanced Features

- **[Feature]**: Tagging and Searching Journal Entries
  - **Complexity**: Complex
  - **Rationale**: Significantly enhances the utility of the journal by allowing users to organize, categorize, and efficiently retrieve entries based on tags or keywords.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Ability to add tags to entries (e.g., inline syntax like `#projectX @meeting` or via metadata). CLI commands to search entries by tags, keywords, or date ranges.
  - **Dependencies**: May require Research: Alternative Data Storage Formats/Systems.

- **[Feature]**: Support for Multiple Journals
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Allows users to separate different types of journaling (e.g., work, personal, project-specific) into distinct collections, improving organization and focus.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Users can configure and switch between multiple journal directories or named journal contexts via CLI commands or configuration.

- **[Feature]**: Encryption for Journal Files
  - **Complexity**: Complex
  - **Rationale**: Enhances user privacy and data security by protecting sensitive journal entries from unauthorized access.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Option to encrypt journal files (e.g., using age or a similar library) that require a password or key to decrypt and access.
  - **Dependencies**: Bolster Security Practices, Implement Externalized Configuration Management.

### Data & Storage Strategy

- **[Research]**: Alternative Data Storage Formats/Systems
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Explore alternatives to plain text files (e.g., Markdown with frontmatter, SQLite, a simple document database) to better support advanced features like rich metadata, tagging, complex queries, and potentially versioning.
  - **Expected Outcome**: A recommendation on a data storage strategy based on feature goals (especially tagging/searching), complexity, performance considerations, and ease of migration.
  - **Dependencies**: Tagging and Searching Journal Entries (as a driver for this research).

### Innovation & Extensibility

- **[PoC]**: Plugin System for Extensibility
  - **Complexity**: Complex
  - **Rationale**: Allow users or third-party developers to extend Ponder's functionality with custom commands, entry formats, pre/post processing hooks, or integrations, fostering a richer ecosystem.
  - **Expected Outcome**: A proof-of-concept demonstrating a basic plugin architecture (e.g., external scripts called via hooks, dynamically loaded WASM modules, or a simple RPC mechanism). Define a basic plugin API.

### Operational Excellence & User Experience

- **[Enhancement]**: Comprehensive Observability (Metrics & Tracing)
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: While less critical for a simple CLI, if Ponder evolves or integrates with other services, having metrics (e.g., command execution times, error rates) and distributed tracing could be valuable for performance analysis and debugging.
  - **Expected Outcome**: If deemed necessary based on complexity or integration points, basic metrics collection (e.g., using `metrics` crate or `tracing` ecosystem) for key operations. For a CLI, this might involve local aggregation or conditional reporting.

- **[Enhancement]**: Backup and Recovery Mechanisms
  - **Complexity**: Medium
  - **Rationale**: Provide users with simple ways to back up their journal entries to prevent data loss, enhancing trust and reliability.
  - **Expected Outcome**: A CLI command to export all journal entries into a compressed archive. Potentially explore simple integration with user-specified backup locations or cloud storage (as a very advanced step).
  - **Dependencies**: Implement Externalized Configuration Management.
